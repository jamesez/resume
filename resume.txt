 * Designed and implemented Macintosh desktop environment
   from Mac OS 10.3 on:
     10.3: Based on radmind, tightly controlled;
     10.4: Custom NetInstall solution;
     10.5: Streamlined initial load, automated and 
           simplified package installer, easy maintenance;
     10.6: Optimized, single-image deployment from
           automatically built image.
   Beginning with 10.4, built central Open Directory
     server for computer logins, etc., including a custom
     in-house password reset portal for users.
   With 10.6, Mac desktops authenticate to our Windows
     Active Directory, but rely on an OD server for
     managed preferences.
   Apple Certified Mac Technician: performed on-site
     hardware repair and troubleshooting.
     
 * Network administration: replaced LSI's Cisco-based
   network with new HP ProCurves.  Specified, installed,
   and deployed all new switches.  Ensured compatibility
   with existing Cisco VoIP handsets and wireless APs.
   New network uses 10 GbE backbone.  Saved LSI over
   $250,000 by doing it in-house with HP switches.

 * Wrote miscellaneous smaller tools, such as:
     GroupWise-to-Exchange converter, to convert e-mail,
       calendar, and address book entries.  Used this
       tool to port 90+ users from GroupWise in under

   original ColdFusion/Access site (1996) through a rewrite
   to ASP/MSSQL (1996-2000), then again to PHP/PostgreSQL
   (2000-current), now onto Ruby on Rails (in closed beta).
   
   Challenges include a hand-tuned subsetting calculator,
   very specific content delivery timing requirements,
   and now video delivery.
   
   Sponsor portal is at http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu
   
   In early 2010, I built a specialized portal for members
   of the press, at http://press.sca.isr.umich.edu
   
   
System Administrator                             2000-2003

   accepted FTP'd PDF and SGML files, inserted them into 
   Informix Illustra, displayed articles to publishing 
   editors who would then approve them for final production.  
   Approved whole issues would be batched together for a 
   nightly delivery to indexing services and other 
   subscribers.

   material that was not publishable - e.g., source code - 
   and for readers to access and download that material.

EDUCATION
=========
  2000: B.S.E. in Computer Engineering, Cum Laude
        University of Michigan College of Engineering
        
        
BUZZWORDS
=========
  I prefer programming in Ruby or Objective-C, but have 
  written significant production code in C, C++, Java, PHP, 
  and VB.
  
  Much of my code is on http://git.lsi.umich.edu and
  http://github.com/jamesez.  Some of the line of business
  apps are not public but I can provide code if requested.
  
  My HTML goes back to the one pixel GIF and tables within 
  tables, but I prefer CSS these days.
  
  I love git, but any version control is better than none.  
  
  I believe in using technologies that are appropriate 
  rather than sticking with set ideology, but I am quick 
  to use new technologies that have actual improvements; I 
  think Exchange is a pretty good calendar server, but I 
  prefer my Mac desktop and I'd rather be coding with RoR 
  than JSP.
